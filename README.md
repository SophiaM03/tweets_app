## Tweet User Cards App

# Description

Some comments about functionality, in this application we have simple routing
and API requests to get users tweets data. Also was created simple filter, in
this filter you have 3 variants of filtering (all users, users wich we followed,
users we can following). For example, if we followed for 3 users, and choose
filter 'Followings', and unfollow from some user, this user will stay in ui
while we don't change filter value (was implemented with this logic because user
can change his mind and follow user again, also I didn't see directly
requirements for filter functionality).
